This is a copy of code that Ross Paterson used to host. The original files have 
disappeared since around 2015 or so. I made minimal changes to make this build on
Linux. The main changes were to add datarootdir to the Makefile.in files for autoconf
2.60+ and to change the getline function to hope_getline.

You'll need to install a few extra packages for a successful build:

) The linux disto for windows come pretty much stripped, so you'll need to install the following
    a) gcc
    b) make
    b) man-db
    c) bison
    d) autoconf
    e) texlive
    f) byacc
    g) gawk
    h) latex2html

The following commands may be required for the install of these packages on a Debian like system.

     sudo apt-get install gcc
     sudo apt-get install make
     sudo apt-get install man-db
     sudo apt-get install bison
     sudo apt-get install autoconf
     sudo apt-get install yacc
     sudo apt-get install byacc
     sudo apt-get install latex
     sudo apt-get install texlive
     sudo texhash
     sudo apt-get install gawk
     sudo apt-get install latex2html
